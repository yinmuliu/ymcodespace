## 👋 Hi there, I'm Yinmu Liu (刘殷沐)

### A little bit about me
- 🇨🇳. I was born and raised in China.
- 🇦🇺. I arrived in Melbourne in 2013. I have lived here for nearly a decade, time flies! 
- 🌐. I speak Mandarin at home and English at work. I learnt Japanese and French for fun and still at beginner's level, hope to find someone to practice!
- 🎓. I have a Bachelor's degree in Anthropology and Linguistics. Learning different cultures and languages is great fun!
- 👩‍🏫. I love to know more about how people can best learn, so I did a Master of Teaching degree, interning in Bendigo, Victoria for two years (2020-2021).
- 💻. My interest for programming grew and grew when I tried lots of ICT tools to teach my students - Wow, how do they make this? How can I make this? How could I improve this? 
- ☕. So I started learning Java (my first programming language) in 2022. 
- 🧗‍♀️. This is why I am here, embarking on an exciting journey to learn how to code!!
- 📗. I am updating my learning notes here @ Medium blog: https://medium.com/@yinmu.liu
